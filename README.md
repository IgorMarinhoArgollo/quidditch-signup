# Quidditch Fans Registration Form Project
This project was inspired on a project I did while studying Fundamentals of Web Development in the Trybe course. The project I did during the course was done in pair programming with a friend <a href="https://github.com/Felpsmars" target="_blank">Luiz Felipe Martins</a> later I refactored the code to style it and add some functionalities.
<br>
 As at that time I didn't know yet how to create routes or post it anywhere, this form does not send the information anywhere but it shows that I know how to build forms.
<br>
 Interesting points:
 * Change of style (background) depending on forms filling;
 * Easter eggs on the app;
 * Responsive design.
